# Snazzy Store

This is a Full Stack E-Commerce app built with Django and React. This is a hobby project of mine that I am constantly building on, but at the time of writing this, here are some of the notable features:

 - JWT authentication on api endpoints with auth flow implemented on the FE. (Login, Registration, and authenticated endpoint calls)
 - Item categories
 - User specific Cart
 - User and Item specific reviews
 - Image/Item uploading
 - Deployed on an EC2 instance and publically accessible via [Snazzy Store](http://snazzy.lassetter.net)
